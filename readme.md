# Homework #2

Created a mobile responsive website with three links.

The "Contact" link opens in a new tab, the others do not.

Used the card element from bootstrap.css

Used media queries to change how the navigation bar looks on a small screen (<576px).
I essentially created two navigation bars, one that would display on screens >576px and then hide when the screen is <576px (using a media query).
The second navigation bar would hide on screens >576px and only display on screens <576px.
There probably is a more elegant way of doing this that I am not sure about.

For the portfolio page, I created the floating labels with "relative positioning" within the card container.
